        <h1>Boilerplate Practice</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This is my html boilerplate practice website. 
            I am very pleased to be learning web design.
            I'm looking forward to having an understanding of
            the entire process, hosting domains, developing back end
            structures and integrating my GMS2 games on websites ive
            designed.
        </p>
        <h2>What ive learned so far</h2>
        <p>So far I have learned how the internet works, how to
            navigate the CLI, setting up github repositories and 
            connect them to a device. Additionally I have developed 
            skills using VSC. I had a very basic knowledge how to use 
            this software but now I feel much more comfortable in the 
            environment and I'm getting more familiar with the various
            shortcuts to streamline my workflow.
        </p>
        <p>Currently I am learning some HTML basics. Using different tags to 
            structure the data within the webpage. For example !DOCTYPE, html, 
            meta, title, head, body, h1-6, p, header, footer. Thats all 
            ive used in the file at the point of writing this. I dont quite
            have a reason to use <strong>strong</strong> or <em>em</em> yet.
            But i'm sure something will come up!
